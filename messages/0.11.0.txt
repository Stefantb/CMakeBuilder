- Add "Edit Cache" command. This will simply open the CMakeCache.txt file.

- Made variable names in the CMakeCache.txt syntax (locally) indexable.
  What this means in practice is that you can "goto anything", type an
  "@" character and all of the variables will show up if you're looking
  at a cache file.

- Remove deprecated command "CMake Clear Cache And Configure".

- Allow this package to be a zip file. What this means is that you'll
  no longer find CMakeBuilder in the Packages directory, but in the
  Installed Packages directory. If you still want to hack on CMakeBuilder,
  consider cloning this package via GitHub.

- Made the decision to put the "cmake" dict in the "settings" dict of the
  project file. This allows the plugin to react to changes in a more
  dynamic way.

- Set "reconfigure_on_save" to "true" by default.

- Various improvements to handling settings.

- "reconfigure_on_save" also reacts to changes to the cmake dict now.

- Set "write_build_targets_after_successful_configure" to "true" by
  default.
