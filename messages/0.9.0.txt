Dear earlybirds,

This is version 0.9 of CMakeBuilder. I believe it has reached a mature
state, so it's almost ready for version 1.0.

- Fix write_build_targets overwriting all of your other build systems.

  Previously, all other build systems that were present got overwritten.
  This is no longer the case; all your custom-written build systems
  remain intact.

- Allow custom name for your new build system.

  This is realized as a new setting called

    "generated_name_for_build_system"

  By default, its value is "${project_base_name} (${platform})". When
  combined with the above fix, this allows multiple build systems (per
  platform) to live inside a single sublime project file. Thus, it should
  be possible to have a single cross-platform sublime project file now.

- Remove deprecated commands.

  Use the settings, Luke!

- Uniformize getting settings

  Every setting can be overridden in the "settings" dictionary of your
  sublime project file. For instance, if you want
  "silence_developer_warnings" to be off by default, but on for a
  particular project, you can do so in the settings of the project file.

- Add a link to the README in the preferences like a pro.
