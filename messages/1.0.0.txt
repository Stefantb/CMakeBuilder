Whew version 1.0.0 !

Thanks for sticking around!

- Add "Edit Cache" command. This will simply open the CMakeCache.txt file.

- Made variable names in the CMakeCache.txt syntax (locally) indexable.
  What this means in practise is that you can "goto anything", type an
  "@" character and all of the variables will show up if you're looking
  at a cache file.

- Remove deprecated command "CMake Clear Cache And Configure".

- Allow this package to be a zip file. What this means is that you'll
  no longer find CMakeBuilder in the Packages directory, but in the
  Installed Packages directory. If you still want to hack on CMakeBuilder,
  consider cloning this package via GitHub.

## FUTURE ROADMAP
I'm intrigued by CMake's experimental "server" feature that is available
since version 3.7. It's supposed to give IDE-like features to editors.
For version 2.0 of this plugin, I intend to take advantage of these server
capabilities.
