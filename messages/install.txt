Thanks for trying CMakeBuilder!

This plugin is very simple and can be seen as "glue" between the CMake build 
system and Sublime Text's own build system. It gives you a few useful utility
commands so that you don't have to leave Sublime Text, for most of the time.
To help CMakeBuilder know where your CMake build folder is, you'll have to have 
a .sublime-project file with a "cmake" dictionary sitting next to "settings", 
"folders", and so forth.

For the "Instruction Manual", please see: https://github.com/rwols/CMakeBuilder

Extra goodies:
- Run your unit tests from within Sublime with CTest
- Diagnose command if you get stuck on what to do
- Syntax highlighting for the CMakeCache.txt file
- Syntax highlighting for the cmake output panel at the configuration step
- Goto error/warning at the configuration step (press F4)

Note that commands are "disabled" when they feel that they cannot be run.
For example, if there is no CMakeLists.txt file in your project folder, the
command "CMakeBuilder: Configure" will not show up in the command palette.
The command "CMakeBuilder: Diagnose" can always be run and you can use that as
a hint as to what is wrong.

This plugin is not a replacement for "serious" build users. In a real build,
you probably want to create shared and static versions of your library, and
debug and release versions. Perhaps 32 bit and 64 bit too. That's what the
command line is for. This plugin is for the developer working on a CMake project
and wanting to quickly build/test the project.
