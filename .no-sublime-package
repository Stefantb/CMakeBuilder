This file exists because CMakeBuilder sets paths to syntax files in various
places. I assume that CMakeBuilder is always present in "Packages/CMakeBuilder".
But if you install it via Package Control, it gets installed to
"Installed Packages/CMakeBuilder.sublime-package". So the paths to the syntax
files get screwed up. Adding a ".no-sublime-package" file tells Package Control
to install the package in the Packages folder, unzipped.
